;; CMUCL/SBCL use a data structure called "source-path" to locate
;; subforms.  The compiler assigns a source-path to each form in a
;; compilation unit.  Compiler notes usually contain the source-path
;; of the error location.
;;
;; Compiled code objects don't contain source paths, only the
;; "toplevel-form-number" and the (sub-) "form-number".  To get from
;; the form-number to the source-path we need the entire toplevel-form
;; (i.e. we have to read the source code).  CMUCL has already some
;; utilities to do this translation, but we use some extended
;; versions, because we need more exact position info.  Apparently
;; Hemlock is happy with the position of the toplevel-form; we also
;; need the position of subforms.
;;
;; We use a special readtable to get the positions of the subforms.
;; The readtable stores the start and end position for each subform in
;; hashtable for later retrieval.
;;
;; This code has been placed in the Public Domain.  All warranties
;; are disclaimed.
